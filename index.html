        <p>
             I joined Computer Science because I want to learn how to code. I know thats what most people say, or want  <br>
            and that probably isn't what this class is about, but I am finding this class to be very interesting. I also want <br>
            to learn how to make websites. I want to learn how to put the coding into the websites by the end of the class. <br>
            I also want to learn how you can put a downloadable object on a website. For example, if I made a game that  <br> 
            I want people to download and play, how would I put the ability for people to download it in a website? If <br>
            it is possible, I would also like to learn how to make a game and code things into it so people can play it. <br>
            I know that this third wish is not probable and will probably not happen, but it is still my hope if my teacher<br>
            is able to teach me this if he wants to.

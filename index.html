        <p>
             I joined Computer Science because I want to learn how to code. I know thats what most people say, or want and that <br> probably isn't what this class is about, but I am finding this class to be very interesting. <br>I also want to learn how to make websites. I want to learn how to put the coding into the websites by <br>the end of the class. I also want to learn how you can put a downloadable object on a website. For <br>example, if I made a game that I want people to download and play, how would I put the ability for <br>people to download it in a website? If it is possible, I would also like to learn how to make a game <br>and code things into it so people can play it. I know that this third wish is not probable and will <br>probably not happen, but it is still my hope if my teacher is able to teach me this if he wants to.

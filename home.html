            Why I am taking Computer Science?
            </h2>
            <p>
                I joined Computer Science because I want to learn how to code. I know thats what <br> most people say, or want and that probably isn't what this class is about, but I am <br> finding this class to be very interesting. I also want to learn how to make websites.

            <h2>
                What do I want to learn from this class?
            </h2>
            <p>  
                I want to learn how to put the coding into the websites by the end of  the class.<br> I also want to learn how you can put a downloadable object on a website. For <br>example, if I made a game that I want people to download and play, how would <br> I put the ability for people to download it in a website? If it is possible, I would <br> also like to learn how to make a game and code things into it so people can play it. <br> I know that this third wish is not probable and will probably not happen, but it is <br> still my hope if my teacher is able to teach me this if he wants to.

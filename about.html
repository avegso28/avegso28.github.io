                My Personality
            </h2>
            <p>
                When I took the 16 personalities test, I did not know what the personalities were, so I had no idea of what my personality was going to be. It turns out that my personality is an Entertainer. The website's description of an entertainer's stregnths are bold, original, practical, observent, and that they have really good people skills. I agree with them saying that I am practical, but I am only sometimes origional. I disagree with them saying that I have good people skills and that I am bold or observent.
            </p>
            <p>
                The website's description of an entertainer's weaknesses are that they are sensative, easily bored, poor long-term planners, unfocused, and they avoid conflict. I agree with almost everything about the weaknesses that I have. The only thing that I partially disagree with is that I can sometimes do long-term planning. I hava a bad temper and I am very sensitive so I get upset at almost everything. Whether that is being mad or sad depends on the events don't like trouble so I try to avoid conflict as much as possible. I also am easily bored so I am unfocused a lot, except when I am playing a game. I also can't think of plans that are over a couple weeks ahead of time, let alone months and even years.
